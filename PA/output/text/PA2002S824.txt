13  number in the order of admission to the voting machines, and at
14  primaries a letter or abbreviation designating the party in
15  whose primary he votes shall also be entered by one of the
16  election officers or clerks. As each voter is found to be
17  qualified and votes, the election officer in charge of the
18  district register shall write or stamp the date of the election
19  or primary, the number of the stub of the ballot issued to him
20  or his number in the order of admission to the voting machines,

22  in whose primary he votes, and shall sign his name or initials
23  in the proper space on the registration card of such voter
24  contained in the district register.
25     As each voter votes, his name in the order of voting shall be
26  recorded in two (2) numbered lists of voters provided for that
27  purpose, with the addition of a note of each voter's party
28  enrollment after his name at primaries.

25  registration commission to examine any records of assisted
26  voters without a court order, in order that the registration
27  commission may ascertain whether electors, who have declared, at
28  the time of registration, their need for assistance, actually
29  did receive assistance when voting at any election.
